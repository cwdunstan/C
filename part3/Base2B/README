======= CONFIG FILE INSTRUCTIONS FOR STAGE 3 =======
To enable stage 3, the setting "stage: 3" should be in the config file. Otherwise, stage 1 will run.
To enable the testing interface, the settings "stage: 3" and "testMode: on" should be in the config file.
To add obstacles to the stage 3 obstacle layout, the setting in the config file should look like this (without quotes):

"obstacles: OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|..." -- each obstacle is separated by a |

To add extra levels to stage 3, they should follow the "newLevel:" identifier in the config files, as follow:

"newLevel: OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE| "

This can be repeated multiple times to add additional levels to the game. Each level will be appended with a checkpoint to signify the end of the level / game.

The format for an OBSTACLE looks like this (without quotes):
"WIDTH,HEIGHT,Y_POSITION,SPACING_UNTIL_NEXT_OBSTACLE,COLOUR_RED,COLOUR_BLUE,COLOUR_GREEN,FLY_RATE"

Powerups can also be added to the obstacle layout, they follow the format of:
"TYPE,Y_POSITION,POSITION_UNTIL_NEXT_OBSTACLE"

Player Lives can also be set in the config file, by setting a value to the "lives:" attribute.
This value must range between 1 and 8.


======= Behavioural Design Pattern Used =======
State Design Pattern
- Level: each level of the game is represented by a state, each storing an obstacle layout and checkpoint at the end of the obstacle sequence.
- On collision with an obstacle, the state will reset and a player life lost.
- On collsion with a checkpoint, the next state will load.
- If the last state is reached, or lives run out, the game will end.

======= Coding Style =======
See README_STAGE1

===== Additional Testing Interface =====
Building on the previous testing interface of stage 2, multiple tests were added to assess the functionality of the powerups. 
It assess the ability of powerups to change player size, as well as trigger a new life to be added on update.
To enable the testing interface, the config file should have the "stage: 3" and "testMode: on" settings. The program will exit upon finishing all test cases.

===== User Control =====
The player can now be controlled. The left arrow will move the player to the left, and the right arrow to the right. The space bar will still jump.

===== Score =====
The player now has a score that is the main goal of the game. points can be achieved in the following way:
- destroying an obstacle by impact from below (+2)
- destroying an obstacle while Powerup is active (+2)
- obtaining a point bonus orb (+50!)
If a player collides with an obstacle during a level, their score will be reset to its value at the start of the level, unless they are able to land directly on an obstacle without moving. The final score will be displayed on completion of the game, or death.

===== Lives =====
The player now has a set amount of lives throughout the game. These lives are displayed as hearts in the top right corner. Lives can be gained through rare powerups, and are lost on collision with obstacles. If the player lives reach 0, the game will end, displaying the players current score.


===== PowerUps =====
There are a total of 4 powerups available in the game:
- 0: Powerup -> The player is set to a Giant size. Although unable to jump in this form, all obstacles will be destroyed on collision, and the player will gain points.
- 1: Shrink -> The player is set to a Tiny size. Although smaller than normal, the player is granted an additional jump, allowing greater mobility.
- 2: Health -> These orbs grant the player an extra life (maximum 8 lives).
- 3: Points -> These orbs grant the player 50 extra points (big bonus).

====Extensions====
- ability to destroy objects by colliding from beneath.
- graphical display of lives with hearts.
- graphical display of checkpoints as flags.
- addition of bonus points and bonus lives.
- Display window for score at end of game / death.
